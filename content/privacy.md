## PRIVACY AND SECURITY
Portland DSA cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. When you submit personally identifiable information via portlanddsa.org, your information is protected both online and offline. Only members who need the information to perform a specific responsibility (for example, sending an email newsletter) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Access to your personal information is restricted within Portland DSA in accordance with our chapter’s Information Privacy and Security Policy. Some authorized members have access to systems that store and process personal information. Those individuals are required to keep personal information secure, and they may not use personal information for any purpose other than to carry out their responsibilities for Portland DSA.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard your personally identifiable information against unauthorized use or disclosure, Portland DSA cannot guarantee that your personal information will never be used in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on portlanddsa.org. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible upon the request of the parent(s). If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@portlanddsa.org.
