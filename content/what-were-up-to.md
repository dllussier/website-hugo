# Campaigns:
## Universal Preschool Now
What if every family was guaranteed high-quality preschool, regardless of their ability to pay? Would it transform your life, or that of someone you know? This can be a reality — from Chicago to Denver to New York City, universal preschool programs are being successfully implemented nationwide. With your support, Multnomah County could vote for universal preschool in November 2020!

Countless families are burdened with monthly childcare costs equal to rent or mortgage payments for just a single child. Many childcare workers report wages so low that they can’t afford to send their own children to preschool. When parents, caregivers, and workers are given the opportunity to choose what is best for their families, our whole community flourishes.

Money invested in early childhood education pays back 7-10% a year, because parents can choose to work. Universal preschool is the single best strategy to raise high school graduation rates and kids’ wages as adults, while, reducing unemployment, incarceration and crime, and lowering economic inequality by race, gender and class.

Everyone deserves the opportunity to thrive. Universal preschool addresses a fundamental social inequity by ensuring that all children are guaranteed a strong foundation on which they can build their lives.

Our vision for universal preschool:
* Ensures that all kids can have the play-based, culturally responsive and inclusive care they deserve.
* Gives caregivers of young children the opportunity to work or go to school.
* Provides a way to pay preschool and childcare workers living wages.
* Builds the political support to sustain funding for a strong preschool program and creates momentum to expand it to younger and older children.

## Portland DSA for Bernie 2020
The Portland chapter of DSA voted in a landslide to join the national DSA Bernie 2020 campaign on July 14, 2019. Our members support this campaign because we recognize that Bernie’s campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination and potentially the Presidency itself throughout 2019 and 2020 creates a unique opportunity for Portland DSA to build our base through engaging in a nationally relevant election. As of July 2019, Portland DSA is supporting Paige Kreisman for Oregon House District 42 as well as the Universal Preschool NOW ballot measure campaign in the same electoral cycle that will potentially share the ballot with Bernie Sanders in the May 2020 primary and/or the November 2020 general election. We see entry into the Bernie 2020 campaign at this moment as a way to increase membership, strengthen our chapter, boost our campaigns, and build support for sharing our socialist vision with the working people of Portland.
