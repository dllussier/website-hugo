callout: Human needs before private wealth.

Democratic socialism is the political conviction that society should be oriented to the common good by granting all members equal political and economic power. We advocate for collective ownership of industry and natural resources, and recognize decent food, healthcare, housing and education as unalienable, universal rights. 

We stand against an economic order based on private profit, inequalities in wealth and power, and oppression based on race, class, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability status, age, religion, and national origin. We reject the brutality and violence inflicted in defense of the status quo.

Our members work on initiatives that build our shared power toward this broad vision.
