  As Democratic Socialists, it takes all of our combined efforts to build an
  inclusive and equitable future. Together, we can challenge establishment
  politics, push back against injustice and create the momentum needed to shift
  political and economic power into the hands of all people.

## Where does the money raised go?

* **Provide Space**: Lease office space to educate, strategize and mobilize.
* **Invest in DSA Campaigns**: Funding support for campaigns such as “Tax the
  Rich” or “Medicare for All.”
* **Support Operations**: Cover costs of web hosting, secure digital
  communication services, database licenses, DSA hosted events, supplies and
  printing.
* **Train Comrades**: Medic/First Aid/CPR training for comrades participating in
  marches and demonstrations. Training for comrades providing child watch
  support.
* **Grow Membership**: Create opportunity for anyone to join DSA despite
  economic barriers.
* **Increase Mobility**: Provide bus passes and/or support for car pool efforts.
* **Plan for the Future**: Build a savings/emergency fund. By building a strong
  financial foundation, we can focus less on getting by month-to-month and more
  on how to grow the Socialist movement strategically into the future.
