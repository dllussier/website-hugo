## Becoming a Dues-paying Member

The Democratic Socialists of America is funded by our membership -- not corporations or wealthy donors. This ensures that DSA members are in full control of the organization. By paying dues, DSA members self-fund our own tools of liberation. As a dues-paying member, you have the right to vote in your local chapter meetings.

## Annual and Monthly Dues

You can choose to pay dues annually or monthly. All annual dues are retained by the national organization. Monthly dues are split between the national organization and local chapters, so we encourage you to select that option if possible. Remember that dues are on a sliding scale, and that no one is turned away for lack of funds.

## Work with us Locally

Ready to organize in Portland? Come to the [next general meeting](http://portlanddsa.org/calendar/) or another event to meet your new comrades in person. Outside of meetings, our day-to-day communications are conducted in the chapter's Slack workspace and on Google Drive. After signing up on the national website, please forward the confirmation email (from Maria Svart) to <mailto:info@portlanddsa.org> and we'll send you invites to both platforms.
