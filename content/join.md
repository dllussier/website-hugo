## Becoming a Member

The Democratic Socialists of America is funded by our membership -- not corporations or wealthy donors. This ensures that DSA members are in full control of the organization. By paying dues, DSA members self-fund our own tools of liberation. As a dues-paying member, you have the right to vote in your local chapter meetings.

## Annual and Monthly Dues

You can choose to pay dues annually or monthly. All annual dues are retained by the national organization. Monthly dues are split between the national organization and local chapters, so we encourage you to select that option if possible. Sign up [here](http://dsausa.org/join). If the standard dues amount would be a financial burden for you, you may fill in any amount you wish or [email](mailto:membership@dsausa.org) to request an exemption. Be sure to also join our [local mailing list](https://sibforms.com/serve/MUIEAFKReA6mXsCyKinBbEQp9k7fjWknzKeNSh5bGgNVNSQkMG28nlXiIWkb1ni56eH_A8014vqf3lISOqJZCG4XpO3wqhmpqUFD9KSU-xPsjPQg136NYT7EptHGyobB31cGaAAtf0lPB1bK9YPTYURVjtqX1JbtwABzQ0mjvlJ3V5EPOIlzpUETj-EMyiomkawLG4DOrCznS3Xc).

## Work with Us Locally

Ready to organize in Portland? Come to the [next general meeting](/calendar) or another event to meet your new comrades in person. Outside of meetings, our day-to-day communications are conducted in the chapter's Slack workspace and on Google Drive. After signing up on the national website, forward the confirmation email (from Maria Svart) to <mailto:membership@portlanddsa.org> and we'll send you invites to both platforms. You can also [donate](https://www.z2systems.com/np/clients/portlanddsa/donation.jsp) to support the activities of the Portland chapter. Log in [here](https://www.z2systems.com/np/clients/portlanddsa/login.jsp) to update your profile for recurring donations.
