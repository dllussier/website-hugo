  chapter presently has over 1,200 members. There are now DSA chapters in more
  than 60 urban and rural regions across the country with more forming everyday.

As socialists, we believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically and collectively to meet public needs and to provide the best possible life for all people. We oppose all forms of oppression such those based on class, gender, and race, we reject all violence in defense of the status quo, and we organize with the ultimate goal of a better society beyond the exploitation of capitalism. We are committed to building our movement through outreach, education, organizing, legislative work, electoral work, collaboration with other organizations, and direct action. While we meet regularly as a chapter, most of our work happens on the ground level in smaller groups organized around our members' various interests.

Unlike many traditional progressive organizations, DSA engages in political activity both within the existing United States electoral system and outside of it, with plenty of room for different approaches according to members’ own ideas. In DSA there's a place for everyone ready to join in the socialist struggle for a better world.
