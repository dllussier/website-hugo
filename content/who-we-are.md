## SOME HISTORY...
The DSA has its roots in the Socialist Party of America (SPA), whose most prominent leaders included Eugene V. Debs, Norman Thomas and Michael Harrington. In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's rightward shift and transformation into the Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC). In 1982, it merged with the New American Movement (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the “New Left” movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the Old Left, to form the DSA. Over the next 35 years, national DSA membership stayed at about 6,000-8,000 until the election of Donald Trump in 2016, which saw membership explode to 32,000 by the end of 2017. As of February 2019 membership is at over 55,000 with no sign of slowing down.

## WHAT KIND OF ORGANIZATION IS DSA?
DSA is a nonprofit political organization, not a party. We are also a “big tent” organization, which means we are multi tenancy, have no litmus tests and are open to people from all corners of the socialist left who share our anti-capitalist vision for the liberation of all people from the systems of oppression empowered by the status quo. For the first time in over a generation, socialist ideas and movements are once again gaining ground and legitimacy in mainstream political discourse and setting the stage for real and meaningful change to take place in our society. Since the election of Donald Trump in 2016, DSA has grown exponentially from this shift of so many people away from the neo-liberal political center and towards the more radical socialist and progressive left.
