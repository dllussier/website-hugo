callout: >-
  As Democratic Socialists, we believe that both the economy and society should 
  be run democratically - to meet public needs, and to fight oppression based on 
  class, gender, and race.

We are a group of democratic socialists based in the Portland metro area who are committed to spreading our movement through outreach, education, organizing legislative work, electoral work, collaboration with other organizations and direct action. We meet regularly as a chapter and in groups based on our interests.

We are a local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America ([DSA](http://dsausa.org)), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA includes people with multiple points of view on socialism and how to achieve it, because we believe that free and open debate is beneficial towards the movement. DSA engages in political activity both within the existing United States electoral system and outside it, with plenty of room for different approaches according to members' own ideas.
