title: Who We Are
type: about
callout: >-
  We are a local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the
  largest socialist organization in the United States with over 47,000 members
  nationally and over 1,000 members locally. DSA is a "big tent," multi-tendency
  organization that includes people with a variety of views on socialism and how
  to achieve it. We believe that free and open debate is beneficial towards our
  movement and welcome people from all corners of the political left.

As socialists, we believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically and collectively to meet public needs and to provide the best possible life for all people. We oppose all forms of oppression such those based on class, gender, and race, we reject all violence in defense of the status quo, and we organize with the ultimate goal of a better society beyond the exploitation of capitalism. We are committed to building our movement through outreach, education, organizing, legislative work, electoral work, collaboration with other organizations, and direct action. While we meet regularly as a chapter, most of our work happens on the ground level in smaller groups based on member's different interests and focuses.

Unlike many traditional progressive organizations, DSA engages in political activity both within the existing United States electoral system and outside of it, with plenty of room for different approaches according to membersâ€™ own ideas. In DSA there's a place for everyone ready to join in the socialist struggle for a better world.
