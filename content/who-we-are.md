## SOME HISTORY...

The DSA has its roots in the Socialist Party of America (SPA), whose most prominent leaders included Eugene V. Debs, Norman Thomas and Michael Harrington. In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's rightward shift and transformation into the Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC). In 1982, it merged with the New American Movement (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the “New Left” movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the Old Left, to form the DSA. Over the next 35 years, national DSA membership stayed at about 6,000-8,000 until the election of Donald Trump in 2016, which saw membership explode to 32,000 by the end of 2017. As of February 2019 membership is at over 55,000 with no sign of slowing down.

## WHAT KIND OF ORGANIZATION IS DSA?

DSA is a nonprofit political organization, not a party. We are also a “big tent” organization, which means we are multi tenancy, have no litmus tests and are open to people from all corners of the socialist left who share our anti-capitalist vision for the liberation of all people from the systems of oppression empowered by the status quo. For the first time in over a generation, socialist ideas and movements are once again gaining ground and legitimacy in mainstream political discourse and setting the stage for real and meaningful change to take place in our society. Since the election of Donald Trump in 2016, DSA has grown exponentially from this shift of so many people away from the neo-liberal political center and towards the more radical socialist and progressive left. 

## WHAT ARE DSA'S GOALS?

We seek to build local, national, and international progressive mass movements for social justice and transformative change while also establishing an openly socialist presence in the Portland metro region. Our chapter is made up of both longtime organizers and people completely new to socialism and political engagement. As socialists we share a vision of a collective, sustainable and just society beyond the exploitation of the capitalist system; one based on radical democracy, public control of resources and production, economic planning to meet human needs, racial and gender equality, and the free development of all people.

## OK, BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS SOCIALISM?

Glad you asked. Despite socialism's re-emergent and growing popularity in U.S. politics and culture, many people still struggle with a consistent answer to this question. This shouldn't be too surprising though, since in the wake of decades of anti-communist cold war rhetoric most of the information floating around the mainstream media about what defines “socialism” spans from misinformed to flat out wrong.

It is often ignored or disregarded that the broad ideas of socialism -- ideas promoting a mutually collective and egalitarian society -- have actually been with humanity in different forms since its earliest beginnings. They are not a contemporary concept. The modern incarnation of what we call socialism today is the evolution of long existing historical ideas and concepts.

While there are lots of different tendencies under the broad tent that is “socialism” there is a common understanding among all of them that socialism is a system based on:

* A society structured around inherent human equality and dignity which promotes and supports the prosperity and free development of all people.
* Democratic worker control of a collective economy designed to meet human needs
* Radical democracy where power is evenly and justly distributed and which grants everyone an equal voice in the decisions that affect their lives
